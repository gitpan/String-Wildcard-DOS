NAME
    String::Wildcard::DOS - DOS wildcard string routines

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of String::Wildcard::DOS (from Perl
    distribution String-Wildcard-DOS), released on 2014-07-26.

SYNOPSIS
        use String::Wildcard::DOS qw(contains_wildcard);

        say 1 if contains_wildcard(""));      # -> 0
        say 1 if contains_wildcard("ab*"));   # -> 1
        say 1 if contains_wildcard("ab\\*")); # -> 1

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  contains_wildcard($str) => bool
    Return true if $str contains DOS wildcard pattern. Wildcard patterns
    include "*" (meaning zero or more characters), "?" (exactly one
    character). There is no backslash escaping mechanism.

TODO
    See String::Wildcard::Bash's TODO for the types of other functions which
    I plan to add to this module.

SEE ALSO
    Regexp::Wildcards to convert a string with wildcard pattern to
    equivalent regexp pattern. Can handle Unix wildcards as well as SQL and
    DOS/Win32. As of this writing (v1.05), it does not handle character
    class ("[...]") and interprets brace expansion differently than bash.

    Other "String::Wildcard::*" modules.
